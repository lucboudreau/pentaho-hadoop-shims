<!--
  - These settings are the minimum necessary YARN settings for the Hortonworks 2.0 Sandbox. The settings for your cluster may be different, please
  - see the descriptions below along with your vendor documentation for the appropriate property values.
  -
  - The Apache defaults (not necessarily vendor-compatible) are listed here:
  - http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/yarn-default.xml
  -->
<configuration>
  <!--
    - The yarn.application.classpath property specifies the classpath to use on the cluster for executing YARN applications.
    - it is included here because when job(s) are submitted from PDI, the yarn-default.xml file in the Hadoop client JAR(s)
    - will be loaded, and the default setting for yarn.application.classpath is not correct for the Hortonworks Sandbox and
    - not compatible with the documented installation of a Hortonworks 2.0 cluster.
    - If these paths are not correct for your sandbox/cluster, update this property accordingly and restart PDI.
